# Contributing to Echo Lab

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Echo Lab** â€” a digital platform for organizing and exploring Black intellectual history.

This file is a placeholder for future contribution guidelines. As the data model and API structure continue to evolve, this document will be updated to reflect:

- How to add new entries to JSON files (`figures`, `titles`, `concepts`, `movements`, `organizations`)
- Naming conventions and structural rules for linked data
- How to contribute code, documentation, or ideas
- Ethical standards for sourcing and attribution

In the meantime, feel free to explore the codebase and submit thoughtful suggestions, issues, or pull requests. This project welcomes developers, educators, researchers, and archivists committed to building digital infrastructure for Black study.

More to come soon.
